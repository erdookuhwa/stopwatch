# Stopwatch

Trying to do some serious time conscious work? Or maybe just challenging a friend to see how fast you can complete a game? 

Need to use a stopwatch but certainly don't want the distractions from your phone... I got you covered :) you can run my stopwatch in a window while you focus without any distrations.

The stopwatch has Start, Stop, and Reset features which lets you start running the stopwatch, stop/pause, and then reset the timer again to begin another lap.
